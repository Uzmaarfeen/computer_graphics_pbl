✅ Illustration of Data Communication Over Internet (Using OpenGL)

We represent:

Sender Node (Computer A)

Receiver Node (Computer B)

Internet / Network Cloud

Data Packets traveling between them

This is purely a visual simulation in OpenGL, meant to demonstrate the concept of data communication.

🧠 Concept Explanation (Simple & Clear)
1. Sender

Sends data in the form of packets

Represented by a box on the left.

2. Internet (Network Cloud)

Medium through which data travels

Represented as a cloud shape or oval.

3. Receiver

Receives packets once they reach the destination

Represented by a box on the right.

4. Data Packets

Moving small rectangles or circles that go from sender → cloud → receiver

Represent the idea of TCP/UDP packets on the Internet.
